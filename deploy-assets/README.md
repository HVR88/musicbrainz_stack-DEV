# <p align="center">**_Limbo for Lidarr_**<br><sub>**Tools WebUI & Full Stack MusicBrainz Server**</sub></p>

## Introduction

Limbo is a set of tools and data bridge for Lidarr, with a full-stack and automated MusicBrainz mirror server installation. Limbo packages the Lidarr Metadata API, and bridges queries to MusicBrainz database, allowing 100% local access to all metadata. That means no more issues with Lidarr database schemas, pre-caching or other nonsense. Just FAST LAN-based performance.

Limbo features its own WebUI, supporting filtering and manipulating media format data for all releases. Maybe you don't want vinyl variations showing up in releases? No problem, filter that out. Maybe you want large media lists to be pruned to focus only on the top candidates - that's easy too.

> [!TIP]

> When deploying from a terminal, use _screen_ or _tmux_ so the compose process can continue running if your session drops (closing the window, computer goes to sleep, etc.)

## Requirements

- Linux server / VM / LXC with Docker support
- 300 GB of available storage (400-500 GB recommended)
- 8 GB of memory available to the container
- 2-4 hours installation time
- MusicBrainz account and Data Feed access token

## Quick start

### 1. Register for MusicBrainz access & token

- Create an account at https://MusicBrainz.com
- Get your _Live Data Feed Access Token_ from Metabrainz https://metabrainz.org/profile

### 2. Download the Limbo compose files (no git required)

Create a folder and download the latest `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env`
from the Limbo release assets (or the raw files in this repo).

```
mkdir -p /opt/docker/limbo
cd /opt/docker/limbo
```

### 3. Copy and configure env file

Copy `example.env` to `.env`, then edit the top section before first run:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

- Set **`MUSICBRAINZ_REPLICATION_TOKEN`**
- Set the **`MUSICBRAINZ_REPLICATION_TOKEN`** (required for replication)
- `MUSICBRAINZ_WEB_SERVER_HOST` ('localhost' default, edit as needed)
- `MUSICBRAINZ_WEB_SERVER_PORT` ('5000' default, edit as needed)
- Optional provider keys/tokens for Limbo (TheAudioDB, Fanart, Last.FM, etc.)

Only `.env` is user-maintained. The stack refreshes managed files (admin scripts,
compose template, and defaults) automatically when you update.

### 4. Download containers, build DB & startup (!) This takes 2-4 hours

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Wrap-up

You can monitor the progress of the long first-time installation jobs from another terminal:

```
docker compose logs -f --timestamps
```

Or with less "noise:"

```
docker compose logs -f --no-log-prefix --tail=200 \
  bootstrap search-bootstrap search musicbrainz indexer indexer-cron limbo

```

## Browser access / status

When finished, the Limbo settings are available at **http://HOST_IP:5001**

And the standard MusicBrainz webUI at **http://HOST_IP:5000**

> [!TIP]
>
> Put a reverse proxy (NPM, Caddy, Traefik, SWAG) in front of your host IP and use your own (sub)domains to reach your Limbo and MusicBrainz LOCALLY on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) (requries two host names, like limbo.yourdomain.net and mbrainz.yourdomain.net)

## Updates

Pull the latest images and restart:

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If a release updates `docker-compose.yml`, run `docker compose up -d` again
after the first restart so the new compose file is applied.

## Migration note (old MBMB_PLUS installs)

If you previously cloned the old repo, update your git remote once:

1. `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HVR88/Limbo`
2. `git pull`

If you were using zip downloads, replace your `docker-compose.yml` and
`example.env` with the new release assets, then re-apply your `.env` settings.

## Migration note (volume prefix and upgrade)

Older installs did not set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. Docker Compose used the
folder name as the project name, which is why volumes are prefixed `mbms_plus_`.
If you rename the folder, Compose will look for new volumes unless you pin the
project name.

You have two options:

1. **Keep using existing `mbms_plus_*` volumes (no migration)**
   - Keep the folder name as `mbms_plus`, **or**
   - Replace `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env` with the new release assets
     (image names changed to `limbo-*`), then re-apply your `.env` values
   - Set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=mbms_plus` in `.env`

2. **Migrate to new `limbo_*` volumes (recommended for new layout)**
   - Replace `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env` with the new release assets
     (image names changed to `limbo-*`), then re-apply your `.env` values
   - Run the migration script:
     ```bash
     admin/upgrade-volumes
     ```
   - Then start the stack:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

The migration script copies data from `mbms_plus_*` to `limbo_*` volumes and
merges any old Limbo init-state volumes into the single pinned
`limbo_bridge_init_state` volume.

## Limbo Configuration

**WORK IN PROGRESS - REWORKING WITHOUT A PLUGIN**

Verify a successful Limbo installation and check versions by opening the Limbo URL in your browser: **http://<your_LIMBO_IP>:5001**

Lidarr is now using the Bridge API and you should see lightning-fast queries to your MusicBrainz mirror.

## Notes

- _The first import and database setup will take multiple hours and requires up to 300GB of available storage_
- Building Materialized/denormalized tables consumes additional storage but offers significant performance improvements
- 60GB of pre-built search indexes are downloaded to save a significant amount of time building new indexes
- _Continued (scheduled) replication and indexing is required to keep the database up-to-date and at optimal performance_
- This stack is configured for private use on a LAN, behind a firewall
- _Don't expose services publicly without hardening_

## Maintenance (optional)

These helper scripts are synced into `admin/` automatically when the stack starts or updates:

- `admin/status` (show container status)
- `admin/logs [services...]` (follow logs)
- `admin/restart [services...]` (restart services)
- `admin/replicate-now` (trigger replication immediately)
- `admin/reindex-now` (trigger search reindex)
- `admin/bootstrap-reset` (clear bootstrap markers; prompts for confirmation)
