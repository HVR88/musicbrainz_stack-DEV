# <p align="center">**_MusicBrainz Mirror Server PLUS_**<br><sub>**Full stack with LM Bridge for Lidarr**</sub></p>

## Introduction

> [!TIP]
>
> When deploying from a terminal, use _screen_ or _tmux_ so the compose process can continue running if your session drops (closing the window, computer goes to sleep, etc.)

## Requirements

- Linux server / VM / LXC with Docker support
- 300 GB of available storage (400-500 GB recommended)
- 8 GB of memory availbale to the container
- 2-4 hours installation time
- MusicBrainz account and Data Feed access token

## Quick start

### 1. Register for MusicBrainz access & token

- Create an account at https://MusicBrainz.com
- Get your _Live Data Feed Access Token_ from Metabrainz https://metabrainz.org/profile

### 2. Download the MBMS_PLUS compose files (no git required)

Create a folder and download the latest `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env`
from the MBMS_PLUS release assets (or the raw files in this repo).

```
mkdir -p /opt/docker/mbms-plus
cd /opt/docker/mbms-plus
```

### 3. Copy and configure env file

Copy `example.env` to `.env`, then edit the top section before first run:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

- **Uncomment `COMPOSE_PROFILES=mbms`**
- **`MUSICBRAINZ_REPLICATION_TOKEN` (required for replication)**
- `MUSICBRAINZ_WEB_SERVER_HOST` ('localhost' default, edit as needed)
- `MUSICBRAINZ_WEB_SERVER_PORT` ('5000' default, edit as needed)
- Optional provider keys/tokens for LM Bridge (TheAudioDB, Fanart, Last.FM, etc.)

Only `.env` is user-maintained. The stack refreshes managed files (admin scripts,
compose template, and defaults) automatically when you update.

### 4. Download containers, build DB & startup

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Wrap-up

You can monitor the progress of the long compose jobs from another terminal:

```
docker compose logs -f --timestamps
```

Or with less "noise:"

```
docker compose logs -f --no-log-prefix --tail=200 \
  bootstrap search-bootstrap search musicbrainz indexer indexer-cron lmbridge

```

When finished, your MusicBrainz mirror will be available at **http://HOST_IP:5000**
<br>The Lidarr API bridge will accept connections at the same address on port 5001

> [!TIP]
>
> Put a reverse proxy (NPM, Caddy, Traefik, SWAG) in front of your host IP and use your own (sub)domain to reach your MusicBrainz mirror on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) on your LAN

## Updates

Pull the latest images and restart:

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If a release updates `docker-compose.yml`, run `docker compose up -d` again
after the first restart so the new compose file is applied.

## LM Bridge Plugin for Lidarr

To use LM Bridge, Lidarr has to have the LM Bridge plugin installed. The plugin sets the API's IP:PORT in Lidarr and allows you to configure media filtering

**Installing the Plugin**

1. In Lidarr, open **System → Plugins**
2. Paste `https://github.com/HVR88/LM-Bridge` into the GitHub URL box and click **Install**.
3. Restart Lidarr when prompted.

If you don't see a _System → Plugins_ page in your Lidarr, switch to the `nightly` branch, such as **[LinuxServer.io's](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/lidarr)**

**Enable the Plugin**

1. In Lidarr, open **Settings → Metadata**
2. Click the **LM Bridge Settings** card
3. Make sure the Enable check-box is checked in the plugin window
4. Enter the URL of the LM Bridge container **http://<your_LM_BRIDGE_IP>:5001**
5. Click Save

Verify a successful LM Bridge installation and check versions by opening the LM Bridge URL in your browser: **http://<your_LM_BRIDGE_IP>:5001**

Lidarr is now using the Bridge API and you should see lightning-fast queries to your MusicBrainz mirror.

## Notes

- _The first import and database setup will take multiple hours and requires up to 300GB of available storage_
- Building Materialized/denormalized tables consumes additioonal storage but offers significant performance improvements
- 60GB of pre-built search indexes are downloaded to save a significant amount of time building new indexes
- _Continued (scheduled) replication and indexing is required to keep the database up-to-date and at optimal performance_
- This stack is configured for private use on a LAN, behind a firewall
- _Don't expose services publicly without hardening_

> [!NOTE]
>
> MBMS PLUS is for personal use: **NO COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS USE IS PERMITTED.**

## Maintenance (optional)

These helper scripts are synced into `admin/` automatically when the stack starts or updates:

- `admin/status` (show container status)
- `admin/logs [services...]` (follow logs)
- `admin/restart [services...]` (restart services)
- `admin/replicate-now` (trigger replication immediately)
- `admin/reindex-now` (trigger search reindex)
- `admin/bootstrap-reset` (clear bootstrap markers; prompts for confirmation)
